# Building and choice data model predict CV
## I. introduction
<p>In this project demo. I user libraries in python to building model predict what job is the CV suitable for?.</p><p>In this project. I collect database of software TopDev. The data has more than 20000 row and 5 columns. I use algorithm machine learning such as logistic regression, support machine learning, ANN, KNN, and decision tree.</p><br>
# II.Introduction to run the code<br>
1. Import library.<br>
2. Read file.<br>
3. Clean data.<br>
4. Get data importance.<br>
5. visualization data<br>
5. convert data to number.<br>
6. train. <br>
